# Computational-Modeling-of-Crack-Propagation-in-Scalar-Elastic-Media

Description:
This repository contains the source code and data for a computational study on crack propagation in scalar-elastic media under uniaxial tension. The project examines how crack length affects global and local force distributions, offering insights into stress concentration and load redistribution. Key outcomes include:

-A correlation between crack length and reduced material strength.
-High local forces near the crack tip that dissipate with distance.
-The material's ability to maintain overall structural integrity despite increasing crack length.

The findings contribute to the understanding of fracture mechanics and inform the design of resilient materials.
